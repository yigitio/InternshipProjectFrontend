      "p1": "Lantern is an internship tracking platform developed to monitor interns’ progress within the company in a more systematic and efficient way. This project aims to improve the feedback and tracking processes by moving beyond basic communication tools like Teams, and instead using an integrated system within the company.",
      "p2": "Lantern was created by a team of four interns: Aykut Eren, Asude Güven, Mustafa Göktuğ Yılmaz, and Yiğit Emre Çay. During the project, Erol Safa Uzun, Mert Erdoğan, Mustafa Şen, and Süleyman Atakan Keçeci acted as mentors; and their guidance played a critical role in the development process. Team leads Anıl Çiçek and Mert Karabulut provided technical support. The project idea was proposed by Erol Safa Uzun and implemented by the team.",
      "p3": "The name Lantern is inspired by the idea of a lighthouse guiding ships through the darkness. This metaphor symbolizes the guiding role of our mentors during the internship journey."
